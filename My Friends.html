  <h2>My Friends</h2>
    <h3>A Bit About Hailee</h3>
      <p>Hailee is an all around great best friend. Me and her have hung out so much recently its incredible. Shes and amazing friend but an even better best friend. One of the best things about me and Hailee being friends is we talk eachothers heads off. We also agree on and enjoy a lot of the same stuff so hanging out is so fun and so easy.She is also a big fan of mermaids so dont bad mouth mermaids around her or your in for a ride.</p>
    
    <h3>A Bit About Nevaeh</h3>
      <p>Nevaeh is the kindest and most caring person i know outside of these three friends. She is so incredibly kind and amazing but if you mess with her she can and will fight back. Me and her are such good friends were basically brother and sister so if you mess with her you will have to go through me first. She is very strong because all that she has gone through in life but though she is strong she still has a beautiful loving and caring heart.</p>
    
    <h3>A Bit About Dominic</h3>
      <p>Dominic....ohhh Dominic he is basically my brother at this point. Me and him have been through so much together its unreal. He may have a depressing view on life sometimes but he is still a good person at heart.He has stuck with me through thick and thin. You mess with one of us and you mess with both of us.</p>
    
    <h3>One Thing To Note</h3>
      <p>You mess with my family or friends you need to go through me. I care for each and every one of my family and friends and I would do whatever it takes to make sure noth my family and friends are safe and happy. My friends are very special friends and they have given me a world of fun and joy and I will make sure they are happy whatever it takes. These three friends ARE my family.</p>
